 Hi, I'm Alex! 

I am currently an AI Systems Engineer at [Growth Shop][8] in the UK, where I lead the architecture and implementation of prescriptive intelligence systems that transform manual growth decision-making into automated, scalable solutions. I design and deploy backend systems integrating LLMs (OpenAI, Claude) with agentic frameworks (LangChain, LangGraph) and build pipelines that turn unstructured data into growth recommendations using RAG, descriptive analytics, and custom decision logic.

I am also Co-Founder of [CaLT][10], a social-first app for personalized event discovery that helps citizens cut through the noise of fragmented event listings and discover cultural experiences that match their interests and availability. We've achieved impressive traction with 1,500+ users and 300 DAUs in our first month, along with 4,000+ saved events and a rapidly growing B2B pipeline. **Download it [here][7]!**

I am a Junior Researcher at the [Information Management Unit (IMU)][6] at [NTUA][2]. I am a part of EU-funded [Swarmchestrate][9], where I am currently working on Complex Event Processing for Swarm-based systems in the Cloud-to-Edge continuum.

In the past, I worked as a Software Engineer in Data at [Software Competitiveness International S.A.][3], working on designing and implementing an AI-ready multi-mission archiving system for the [ESA][4]-funded project "AIMA". I also worked on developing time series forecasting and anomaly detection models, for the Machine Learning Automated Test Processes (MALT-P) project, funded by [ESA][4].

I am an [Electrical & Computer Engineering][1] Master's graduate from [NTUA][2]. My Thesis supervisor was [Dimitrios Tsoumakos][5]. 

My personal research interests lie in Information Access, Personalisation, and LLMs. Specifically, I like to explore:
- How people interact with AI and Information Access Tools
- How LLMs can be incorporated in Personalisation and Recommendation tasks.
- Ways to implement human-centered tools, such as Recommender Systems

<!-- A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html). -->
